    "The binomial distribution is a discrete distribution assigning probabilities to a number of successes (usually assigned a value of $1$) out of a total number of $N$.\n",
    "We assume each of the $N$ trials are independent from one another, that only a success or failure can occur, and that a success occurs with a probability $\\theta$. \n",
    "The binomial distribution is used anytime you ask \"what is the probability of $x$ occurrences of the same event out of a total $N$ number of tries?\"\n",

    "The symbol $\\binom{N}{x}$ is called the a binomial coefficient, sometimes said \"N choose x\". \n",
    "The binomial coefficient (we'll see below) is the number of times you can select $x$ items from a total of $N$ items without caring about the order you selected them. \n",

    "How many ways can i select two dogs from the pack of five in order (ie picking the shaggy then hairy dog is distinct from selecting the hairy then shaggy dog)?\n",

    "We can develop a formula for a combination by relating combinations to permutations (a formula we just came up with earlier). \n",
